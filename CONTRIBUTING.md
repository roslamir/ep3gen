# Contributing to EP3Gen

Thank you for your interest in contributing to EP3Gen! Our vision is to create an easy-to-use EPUB3 e-book generator and while we can’t have everything right from the start, we can build it together! If you plan to implement a feature and open a pull request, make sure you don’t spend a lot of time on it, otherwise open an issue so we can discuss bigger stuff.

The [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide) website has a collection of resources for individuals, communities, and companies who want to learn how to run and contribute to an open-source project. Contributors and people new to open source alike will find the following guides especially useful:

## Helping with Documentation

We use **MarkDown** to build our documentation which is located in the [README](https://github.com/roslamir/ep3gen/tree/main/README.md) file. If you are adding new functionality or introducing a behavior change, we will ask you to update the documentation to reflect your changes.

## Contributing Code
